'''Constraint Satisfaction Routines
   A) class Variable

      This class allows one to define CSP variables.

      Currently no support for backtracking--i.e., can not remember
      and undo changes, so if one wants to implement backtracking
      search an extension is needed.

      On initialization the variable object can be given a name, and
      an original domain of values. This list of domain values can be
      added but NOT deleted from.
      
      To support GAC propagation, the class also maintains a
      current domain for the variable. Values pruned from the variable
      domain are removed from the current domain but not from the
      original domain.

      The current domain can be re-initialized at any point to be
      equal to the original domain.

    B) class constraint

      This class allows one to define constraints specified by tables
      of satisfying assignments.

      On initialization the variables the constraint is over is
      specified (i.e. the scope of the constraint). This must be an
      ORDERED list of variables. This list of variables cannot be
      changed once the constraint object is created.

      Once initialized the constraint can be incrementally initialized
      with a list of satisfying tuples. Each tuple specifies a value
      for each variable in the constraint (in the same ORDER as the
      variables of the constraint were specified).

       in scope. For example, if the constaint scope is specified to be
       [v1, v2, v3], where each vi is a variable object then a
       satisfying tuple will have to be a list of three values. For
       example, the tuple [1, 2, 1] would specify the assignments
